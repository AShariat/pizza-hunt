// Here, we create a variable db that will store the connected database object when the connection is complete. After that, we create the request variable to act as an event listener for the database. That event listener is created when we open the connection to the database using the indexedDB.open() method. As part of the browser's window object, indexedDB is a global variable. Thus, we could say window.indexedDB, but there's no need to. The .open() method we use here takes the following two parameters: 1.The name of the IndexedDB database you'd like to create (if it doesn't exist) or connect to (if it does exist). We'll use the name pizza_hunt. 2.The version of the database. By default, we start it at 1. This parameter is used to determine whether the database's structure has changed between connections. Think of it as if you were changing the columns of a SQL database.
// create variable to hold db connection
let db;
// establish a connection to IndexedDB database called 'pizza_hunt' and set it to version 1
const request = indexedDB.open("pizza_hunt", 1);

// this event will emit if the database version changes (nonexistant to version 1, v1 to v2, etc.)
request.onupgradeneeded = function (event) {
  // save a reference to the database
  const db = event.target.result;
  // create an object store (table) called `new_pizza`, set it to have an auto incrementing primary key of sorts
  db.createObjectStore("new_pizza", { autoIncrement: true });
};

// upon a successful
// This event will also emit every time we interact with the database, so every time it runs we check to see if the app is connected to the internet network. If so, we'll execute the uploadPizza() function.
request.onsuccess = function (event) {
  // when db is successfully created with its object store (from onupgradedneeded event above) or simply established a connection, save reference to db in global variable
  db = event.target.result;

  // check if app is online, if yes run uploadPizza() function to send all local db data to api
  if (navigator.onLine) {
    // With this we'll check to see if we're online every time this app opens and upload any remnant pizza data, just in case we left the app with items still in the local IndexedDB database. That way, users won't have to worry about staying in the app to ensure the data is eventually uploaded—it'll do that for them next time they return!
    uploadPizza();
  }
